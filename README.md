Self-taught, terrible at coding—but I’ve been dabbling with computers and code for a long time and don’t have much to show for it. So I’ve started building apps with a little help from AI. 🤖

# 🕵️ Duplicate File Finder  
**Find, review, and clean up duplicate files with confidence.**  
Built by a self-taught developer 🧑‍💻 with AI assistance.

---

## 🚀 What It Does
This tool helps you identify duplicate files in any folder or drive by scanning for:

- ✅ **Exact Matches**: Same filename, size, and creation date  
- 🔍 **Close Matches**: Same filename, but different size or date  

Perfect for cleaning up cluttered photo libraries, document folders, or backup drives!

---

## 🛠️ Features (v1.0)

- **Smart Scanning**  
  Select any folder (or entire drive!) — the app handles permission errors gracefully and keeps scanning.

- **Progress Visibility**  
  Real-time progress bar + file counter so you know it’s working (even on huge drives!).

- **Safe File Management**  
  Right-click any file to:  
  👁️ **Open File**  
  🗂️ **Open File Path** (in Explorer)  
  🗑️ **Delete File** (with confirmation!)

- **Organized Results**  
  - **Folders Tab**: Browse your directory tree with duplicate counts at every level  
  - **Results Tab**: Grouped by filename — expand to see all duplicate paths  
  - **Exact/Close Tabs**: Flat lists for quick review  

> ⚠️ **Safety First**: No "Delete All" button — because accidentally nuking your files would be *very* bad.

---

## 📦 How to Use

1. Download the latest release (**Windows only**)
2. Run `DuplicateFinder.exe`
3. Click **"Select Folder"**
4. Wait for the scan to complete (or click **Stop** for partial results!)
5. Review duplicates → right-click to manage files

---

## 🔮 Future Ideas (Maybe!)

- 🔍 Filter by file type (images, videos, documents)
- 🚫 Exclude file extensions or folders
- 🧩 Merge Folders + Results views
- 🌓 Dark mode
