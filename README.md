Self taught, terrible at coding but I have been dabbling with computers and code for a long time however I don't have much to show for it, so I've started developing some apps with the help of AI. 

🕵️ Duplicate File Finder
Find, review, and clean up duplicate files with confidence.
Built by a self-taught developer 🧑‍💻 with a little help from AI. 

🚀 What It Does
This tool helps you identify duplicate files in any folder or drive by scanning for:

✅ Exact Matches: Same filename, size, and creation date
🔍 Close Matches: Same filename, but different size or date
Perfect for cleaning up cluttered photo libraries, document folders, or backup drives!

🛠️ Features (v1.0)
Smart Scanning
Select any folder (or entire drive!) — the app handles permission errors gracefully and keeps scanning.
Progress Visibility
Real-time progress bar + file counter so you know it’s working (even on huge drives!).
Safe File Management
Right-click any file to:
👁️ Open File
🗂️ Open File Path (in Explorer)
🗑️ Delete File (with confirmation!)
Organized Results
Folders Tab: Browse your directory tree with duplicate counts at every level
Results Tab: Grouped by filename — expand to see all duplicate paths
Exact/Close Tabs: Flat lists for quick review
⚠️ Safety First: No "Delete All" button — because accidentally nuking your files would be very bad. 

📦 How to Use
Download the latest release (Windows only)
Run DuplicateFinder.exe
Click "Select Folder"
Wait for the scan to complete (or click Stop for partial results!)
Review duplicates → right-click to manage files
🔮 Future Ideas (Maybe!)
🔍 Filter by file type (images, videos, documents)
🚫 Exclude file extensions or folders
🧩 Merge Folders + Results views
🌓 Dark mode
💡 I’m learning as I go — updates may be rare, but I welcome community contributions!
